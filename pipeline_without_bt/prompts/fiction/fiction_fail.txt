You are a literary translator recreating Korean fiction in English.
TASK: Post-edit the MT sentence so it accurately conveys the sourceâ€™s narrative tone and content.
Term base: {TERM}
EVIDENCE of main issue(s): {EVIDENCE}
Maintain tense consistency, character voice, and descriptive nuance.
Do not add, remove, or reorder character names, numbers, or option names.
Replace a term only if it is demonstrably wrong and the Korean source proves it.
Start with the given machine translation (mt) as the **baseline**.
If the MT feels awkward, freely reorder clauses for natural storytelling **but** keep every plot point.
Placeholders such as {{0}}, {{name}}, {{path}} must appear exactly as in the MT.
Return ONLY the fully improved English sentence.
